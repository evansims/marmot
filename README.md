# Marmot

Marmot is a simple password manager that uses a hash algorithm and a master password to generate unique passwords for your web site accounts. Just upload the PHP script to your server, fire it up in your browser and enter your details. Marmot will generate a Javascript bookmarklet that you can use on any site to generate new passwords. It will fill in password form fields if you have them focused when you use it.

The bookmarklet should work in any browser that supports Javascript code in bookmarks, including iPhone.

If you provide an email address, Marmot can email you a receipt of the generated password to store for safe keeping, though there are obvious security implications in doing so.

Marmot is designed to be as minimal and straightforward as possible. The passwords it generates aren’t military grade and obviously shouldn’t be used to protect your nuclear football, but for casual use it should be adequate.
